1. As a farmer working in rural areas with limited access to agricultural experts,

I want to upload a photo of a leaf from my crop using my phone or computer, so that I can instantly find out whether the plant is healthy or affected by a specific disease without needing to send samples or travel long distances.
I need the result to be simple to understand, showing the disease name, plant type, and a clear label such as “Healthy” or “Infected.”

2. As a farmer trying to make treatment decisions,

I want the system to show me the top few possible diseases with confidence scores,
so that I can judge how certain the model is and decide whether to act immediately or confirm with a local agronomist.
If possible, the app should also give me short, non-technical descriptions of each disease (e.g., “common in humid weather, affects lower leaves first”).

3. As a farmer comparing multiple plants,

I want to upload several photos at once or browse recent uploads,
so that I can check whether a problem is spreading across my field and see if the same disease appears in more than one plant.
This helps me plan targeted pesticide or irrigation adjustments instead of treating the whole crop blindly.

4. As an agricultural researcher studying crop health trends,

I want to analyse which plant species and disease types the model predicts most often,
so that I can understand which diseases are most common or most misclassified and use this data to improve model training or collect new samples.
I should be able to view a confusion matrix or performance summary that highlights which classes are harder for the model.
